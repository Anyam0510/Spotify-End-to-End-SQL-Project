# 🎵 Spotify-Inspired Music Streaming Database Project

This project simulates the backend of a **music streaming platform** similar to **Spotify**, built entirely in SQL. It includes everything from schema design to data manipulation, stored procedures, triggers, and analytical queries.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

This SQL-based system replicates core features of Spotify, focusing on **user management**, **music cataloging**, **playlist functionalities**, and **listening behavior tracking**. The project demonstrates best practices in **relational database design**, **data integrity**, and **query optimization**.

## ⚙️ Features Implemented

### 📌 Schema Design
- Users, Artists, Albums, Tracks, Genres
- Playlists, Liked Songs, Subscriptions
- Streaming History and User Activity Logs

### 🔄 Functional Modules
- **User Sign-up/Login** and Subscription Plan Assignment
- **Music Catalog:** Add/update artists, albums, tracks, and genres
- **Playlists & Likes:** Create/manage playlists and liked songs
- **Streaming History:** Record listening activity and playback logs

### 📊 Analytics & Reporting
- Top-streamed artists and tracks
- User-wise listening stats (e.g., most active users)
- Recent plays and genre-based recommendations

### 🔧 SQL Tools Used
- `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- **Joins**, **Subqueries**, and **Aggregations**
- **Views** for simplified data access
- **Stored Procedures** for encapsulated logic
- **Triggers** for automatic data updates
- **Indexing** for performance optimization

- **Database:** MySQL / SQL Server
- **Tools:** MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, or pgAdmin
- **Data Modeling:** ER Diagrams (Optional: Lucidchart/Draw.io)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or copy the `Project.sql` file.
2. Open in MySQL Workbench or your preferred SQL IDE.
3. Run section-by-section:
   - Database & Table creation
   - Sample data insertion
   - Procedures, triggers, and views
4. Execute sample queries to test the system.
